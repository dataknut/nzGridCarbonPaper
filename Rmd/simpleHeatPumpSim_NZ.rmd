# Heat pump impact simple simulation

Create an animation of a simulation of flattening peak. 

We use GREEN Grid heat pump data to calculate the mean kW per half hour.

```{r loadHeatPump}

hpDT <- drake::readd(heatPumpData)

h <- head(hpDT[,.(r_dateTime, r_dateTimeLubridated, rDateTimeNZT, halfHour)])
h

#uniqueN(hpDT$halfHour)
hpDT[, .(minTime = min(hms),
         maxTime = max(hms)),
     keyby = .(halfHour)]


baselineDT <- hpDT[, .(meankW = mean(powerW/1000)), keyby = .(year, season, halfHour)]


# check plot
ggplot2::ggplot(baselineDT[year == 2015], aes(x = halfHour, y = meankW, colour = season)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(year ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Time",
       y = "Mean kW",
       caption = "Data: NZ GREEN Grid households")
```

which suggests ~0.6 kW power in the morning peak and 0.5 in the evening. Perhaps people light woodburners in the evening?

BRANZ HCS 2015:
 * 40% owner-occupiers have HPs
 * 25% rentals

NZ Census:
 * 64% X m owner-occupied -> 1,228,500
 * 32% Y m rentals -> 609,700
 * 4% (?) rent-free -> 65,200 (we treat these as owned)

First we inflate it by adding 1 kW heat pump per house - which we assume needs 0.5 kWh per half hour. For 2 million households. That +1 GWh :-)

hpsOwner <- 0.4 * nOwner
hpsRenter <- 0.25 * nRenter



baselineDT[, hpCurrentMeanMW := ((meankW * hpsOwner) + (meankW * hpsRenter))/1000]
baselineDT[, hpCurrentMeanMWh := hpCurrentMeanMW/2]

# model to 100%
newHPsOwner <- nOwner * (1-0.4) # 40% already have them
newHPsRenter <- nRenter * (1-0.25) # 40% already have them
